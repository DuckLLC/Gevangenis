# Contributing to Gevangenis

Contributing to Gevangenis is my way of letting the community help add new items to the game!

# Using the "API Methods"

First, any method with proper documentation is free game

- USE OF ANY METHOUDS WITHOUT DOCUMENTATION AND ANTIONATION IS STRICTY DISALLOWED AND WILL RESULT IN YOUR REQUEST DENIED

# Current Allowed Methods

- setNBTData(ItemStack itemStack, String key, String value) - This is a static method

All allowed methods will allow you to create items. You are also allowed to use the full bukkit API

# Allowed Submitions

All Submitions should be:
- One File Large
- DO NOT EDIT THE MAIN.JAVA File
- Strictly only creates and item
